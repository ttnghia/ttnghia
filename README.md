### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a Distributed System Software Engineer at @NVIDIA, working on CUDA-accelerated Apache Spark (https://nvidia.github.io/spark-rapids/). Before joining NVIDIA, I did my PhD in Scientific Computing from School of Computing, University of Utah. My PhD research included a wide range of problems in physics-based simulation and real-time rendering.
