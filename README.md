### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m a System Software Engineer at @NVIDIA, working on CUDA-accelerated Apache Spark. Before joining NVIDIA, I did my PhD in Scientific Computing from School of Computing, University of Utah. My PhD research included a wide range of problems in physics-based simulation and real-time rendering. After graduated from PhD, I decided not to pursue a career in the academia but instead to be a Software Engineer in the industry.
